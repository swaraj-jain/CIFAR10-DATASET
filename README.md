<h2>Things that helpme out</h2>
<ol>
<li>
    
    Used VGG16 model ,adding some dense connected layer at top,and using finetunning and transferlearning by which 
    i got an overfit model with 96% train accuracy ,And 82.41% test accuracy
</li>
<li>

    Used a model same as VGG16 structure but with dropout,Which decrease the overfitting. Achieved a train accuracy
    of 87% and test accuracy of 84%.Traning for more epochs may help out as the model is getting underfit 
</li>
<li>

    Using Dataaugmentaion with same model used in second and achieved a trainaccuracy of 86% and test accuracy of 89%.
    It seems quite good model,Traning for more epoches on changing costfunction and all can increase the accuracy.
